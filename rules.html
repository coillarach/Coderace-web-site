<h1>Game rules</h1><h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>

The details that you provide on this site will be used to allow other players to contact you. You should therefore assume that your name and email address will be publicly visible. 

</p><p>

No financial details are held on this site. Payment of Coderace entry fees are made through Edinburgh Napier University's online payment system which is fully protected and complies with all legal requirements. It is for this reason that the person who pays your team;s fee will need to register separately on the payment system.

</p><p>

If you choose to recruit team members through this site, you may occasionally receive alert emails to let you know for example that someone wishes to join your team. After the initial automated message, it will be up to you and the other player to contact each other directly.

</p><p>

Apart from alert messages, you can choose to receive two other types of communication. You can opt in for news about the 2012 event, and you can also choose to receive messages about any future events. You will not receive these messages unless you check the appropriate box during registration or on your profile page.

</p>

<h2>Player responsibilities</h2>

<p>

As a participant you are responsible for your own conduct during the Coderace event. In particular, you must observe all relevant laws and regulations concerning the use of bicycles or any other form of transport you choose to use. You must be aware that taking part in the Coderace event does not protect you in any way from prosecution or other legal process.

</p><p>

You will be asked to sign a waiver acknowledging your acceptance of these responsibilities before the start of the event.

</p><p>

To take part in the game, you must provide your own Android mobile device with an Internet connection. You are responsible for any charges associated with your use of the mobile phone network. To minimise the risk of technical issues, you should install the Coderace application in advance of the event and try it out using the test game.

</p>

<h2>Game rules</h2>

<p>

The start and end times of the event are controlled from the game server. Players will be notified when the game is over.

</p><p>

Locations will become visible at different times though the Coderace app. Players will need to travel to a location, solve the clue to find the location's code and enter it into the Coderace app to claim it for their team.

</p><p>

A location is claimed by the first team to enter the correct code and have it accepted by the server. Thus should two players enter a correct code at the same time, the winning claim is the one which is processed first by the server.

</p><p>

Players must not try to prevent other players from reaching a location, finding a code or entering the code into the Coderace app. Any players found interfering with others risk the disqualification of their team.

</p><p>

In any dispute, the organisers' decision will be final.
